# Hands on Live Session on Basics of Linear Algebra 
This notebook consists of codes as discussed in the session along with some additions from my side. 

## Contents:

#### 1. Vectors and hyper-planes
      * Representing a Vector
      * Representing a Unit Vector
      * Angle between 2 vectors 
      * Distance of a point from a plane
      * Positive and negative half-spaces
      
#### 2. Matrix operations
      * Element-wise sum
      * Element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product)
      * Matrix multiplication 
      * Frobenius norm of a matrix
      * Determinant of a matrix
      * Inverse of a square matrix
      * Covariance of a matrix

#### 3. Convolution fundamentals (A high-level overview)

#### 4. Hyperspheres
      * Hyperspehers as extension of 2D Circles
      * Distance of a point from centre
      * Shortest distance of a point from a hypersphere
